# Project 03 - E-Commerce Application with GraphQL + Prisma & TypeScript

A Udemy training **[Modern GraphQL with Node - Complete Developers Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-graphql-complete-guide)** how to use GraphQL with Node.js/TypeScript. The main goal with this course is to learn how to build a GraphQL applications using Node.js + Prisma + Apollo.

## üöÄ Resources Used

- ‚úÖ **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-14034-gllemos)**
- ‚úÖ **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
- ‚úÖ **[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)**
- ‚úÖ **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**

## üñ•Ô∏è How to execute the application?

To run the application first you need to install all the dependencies in: (in the root of the application)

```bash
> npm install
```

After to install all the dependencies, now you need to go to the main root, where is the `package.json`, and then execute the command:

```bash
> npm run dev
```

Now, open a browser and go to the `localhost:4000/graphql`. Will open a GraphQL Playground.
To test if it is working use this query as a test: (there's another queries in the `rest.http`)

```gql
```
